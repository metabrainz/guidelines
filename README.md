# Guidelines for contributing to MetaBrainz projects

This is a set of guidelines for contributing to MetaBrainz projects. These
include general tips on how to use Git/GitHub and more specific advice on how
to write code using the different programming languages or frameworks that we use.

## Overview

Everyone is welcome to contribute to any of the MetaBrainz projects.
Implementing new features, fixing known issues or reporting new ones, improving
documentation, etc. There are plenty of ways to get involved in the development
process.

The source code for most MetaBrainz projects is hosted under the [MetaBrainz
organization on GitHub](https://github.com/metabrainz). *There are some
exceptions like [BookBrainz project](https://github.com/bookbrainz) or
[AcousticBrainz GUI](https://github.com/MTG/acousticbrainz-gui).*

Our bug tracker is located at https://tickets.metabrainz.org/. All issues
should be reported there, under a specific project. Project list is located at
https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/BrowseProjects.jspa. You will need to
create a separate account to create new issues and interact with existing ones.

Any problems or comments on these guidelines can also be reported using
our bug tracker. File them under the 'Guidelines' component of the
OTHER project: https://tickets.metabrainz.org/projects/OTHER

Our developers use IRC for communication. You can join us in the
[#metabrainz](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/metabrainz) channel on the
[Libera.Chat network](https://libera.chat/). Feel free to come and say "Hi!" if
you want to know more about the development process. More info about interesting
ways we communicate with each other is available at https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Communication.
